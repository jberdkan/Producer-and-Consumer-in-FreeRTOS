In this practice, we will follow the textbook example (used in In-class practice) to build a circular buffer and semaphores to synchronize three tasks. One task (producer) send a message to the buffer, and the others (two consumers) waiting for the message to flash LED lights. The following instruction only shows the CubeMX steps. You need to figure out the source code based on the textbook example. 
The choice between a semaphore-based method and a queue-based method hinges on the specific requirements and design considerations of the system at hand. Semaphore-based methods excel in controlling access to shared resources and coordinating task execution, making them suitable for scenarios where tasks need synchronized access to critical resources. However, they can introduce complexities such as deadlocks and priority inversions if not used carefully. On the other hand, queue-based methods are ideal for facilitating asynchronous communication between tasks, offering a simpler and more efficient means of passing data or messages between them. Queues are less prone to synchronization issues and are easier to use compared to semaphores. The optimal choice between the two approaches depends on factors such as the nature of the tasks, synchronization requirements, and overall system design goals. In some cases, a combination of both methods may be employed to leverage their respective strengths for effective task synchronization and communication.
